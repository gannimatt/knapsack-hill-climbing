# Java Hill Climbing for Knapsack

## Overview

This project implements a **Hill Climbing algorithm** to solve the **0/1 Knapsack Problem** using Java. The goal is to find the optimal combination of items to maximize total value without exceeding the knapsack's capacity.

## Problem Background

The 0/1 Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization challenge where you're given a set of items, each with a specific weight and value, and a knapsack with a weight limit. The objective is to determine the subset of items to include in the knapsack so that the total weight is within the limit and the total value is maximized. In the 0/1 version, each item can either be taken (1) or not taken (0).

## Algorithm: Hill Climbing

Hill Climbing is a local search algorithm that iteratively moves towards better neighboring solutions. In this implementation:

- A valid initial solution is randomly generated.
- At each iteration, a neighbor is generated by flipping one bit in the current best solution.
- If the neighbor has a higher value and is valid, it becomes the new best.
- The process repeats for a fixed number of iterations (10,000 by default).

## Features

- Reads problem data from a file
- Generates a valid initial solution
- Performs iterative improvement via Hill Climbing
- Prints the progress and final solution to the console

## How to Run

1. **Ensure you have Java installed.**
2. **Place your input data file in the `src/` directory and name it `data`.**
    - The format should be:
      ```
      <capacity>
      <weight1> <value1>
      <weight2> <value2>
      ...
      ```
3. **Compile and run the project:**
   ```bash
   javac KnapsackHillClimbing.java
   java KnapsackHillClimbing
   ```

The main class is `KnapsackHillClimbing`, and it reads input from `src/data`.

## Example Input File

```
50
10 60
20 100
30 120
```
